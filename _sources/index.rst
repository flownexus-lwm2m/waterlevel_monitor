Waterlevel Monitor Documentation
================================

This project serves as an example application that uses Flownexus. The hardware
consists of a Nordic Thingy:91 with a connected pressure sensor. The pressure
sensor measures the height of a water column in a water tank.

As firmware the Zephyr OS is used. It provides a LwM2M client, security and the
possibility of installing OTA Updates in a reliable way using two partitions.
